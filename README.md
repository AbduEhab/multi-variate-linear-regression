# multi-variate-linear-regression
The linear regression model of a milti-variate n-dimensional feature vector. Implemented using `gradient descent`, `least squares`, `scikit-learn` and `Tensorflow`.

Each run will generate a different dataset.

> Note: sometimes the sqrt method breaks as it fails to find a solution to the given dataset. Please re-run the main file to generate a new set.
